## Looking through theory's lens
<p>Lev Manovich, in <em>The Language of New Media</em>, proposes five "principles of new media," or essential features that shape how digital media behave:</p>
<ul>
    <li>numerical representation: new media objects can be described or manipulated mathematically</li>
    <li>modularity: new media objects are composed of independent elements that can separated or acted on independently</li>
    <li>automation: actions on new media objects can be performed by other new media objects, seemingly without direct human action, allowing humans to "collaborate with the machine"</li>
    <li>variability: new media objects have no fixed form, but maintain their identity through changing representations</li>
    <li>transcoding: we understand culture through the lens of computers, and computers through the lens of culture</li>
</ul>


## Your task:
How well do these aspects of digitality line up with the story you wrote for the main activity? In other words: what do they help you see about the digital or analog objects and habits that you described there? What do you see differently now? What questions do they raise about the changes you narrated? On the flip side: does your story help you understand any of Manovich's terms differently?

**Discuss as a group.** When you're ready, edit this file, and in the section below try to articulate the highlights and main takeaways (including any unanswered questions) from your discussion.
